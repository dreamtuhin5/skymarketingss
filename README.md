Antispam and phishing verification: techniques that emails must have in their filters 

Due to its characteristics, email is the quintessential method for exchanging messages, making it one of the most used tools by companies. 

However, this medium is also one of the main avenues for malware attacks. Therefore, it is necessary that the solution applies antispam and phishing verification techniques that guarantee the protection you require. In this article, we share some filtering techniques and a comprehensive solution to prevent spam and phishing.  

 Email is the preferred medium of cyber-attacks. The cause can be attributed to ignorance of the process to detect malicious emails, which generates an out-of-date or poorly configured filtering solution. In this way, email becomes an easy door to open to introducing spam with phishing techniques. 
 
Filtering techniques that the email solution must have 

 Among the existing methods for antispam and phishing protection, we present those that are considered essential in any email filtering solution, so that it contributes to having a detection rate at the highest levels. 
 
Reverse DNS lookup 

When receiving an email, servers typically look for the DNS MX record that contains the host address of the server it was sent from. 

Performing a reverse lookup on the IP address is important to identify the same host address. If this does not happen, it could be an indicator that the mail server in question is being used for malicious purposes. 

 Black Lists  
 
 This is a simple method to identify the IP addresses and domains that send malicious emails. It is necessary to keep the feed open in order to update these lists. 
 
Antivirus and process isolation 

Cyber attackers find new ways to intrude malware on our devices. Currently, it is unusual for malicious files to be directly in an email, making it cheaper and more cost-effective to ensure that all information received is scanned by known firms. In the event of a negative reaction, the files will need to be sent to a secure security environment. 

In general, malware comes as hyperlinks in the body of the email, which is why it cannot be detected by the scan because the malicious code is absent from the email itself.

For situations like this, all companies need to protect themselves against malware. In this link, you can read more about it.  

In such a situation, it is imperative to consider that good email filters include URL tracking techniques, which also scan the destination of any hyperlink contained in the emails. Are you aware of the key tools?

  SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) verification antispam and phishing 
  
When two STPMs of electronic servers are connected, they identify each other by means of their respectively configured hostnames in their SMTPs. 

 If your corresponding DNS MX does not match, you can assume that the sending server is unaware that it is being used to send spam from that domain, which may be due to poor configuration; in which case, it could also be an indicator of a hijacked [email hosting UK](https://www.theemailshop.co.uk/email-hosting-uk/). 
 
Registration of SPF (Sender Policy Framework) 

 The SPF is a DNS record in the domain of the sending host, which lists all the [email hosting](https://www.theemailshop.co.uk/email-hosting-uk/) capable of sending emails from your domain. 
 
 SPF is a fairly simple technique to prevent domain spoofing. However, it is surprisingly little known. 
 
The recipient's servers can consult and compare this list with the address of the server from which the email was sent. This ensures that they are allowed. If not, then we could be facing a kind of malware that needs to be ruled out immediately. Antispam and phishing makes sure your email solution uses these antispam and phishing techniques.
